**My role:** Graduate research assistant on quantitative analysis (2015 - 2019)

*Carbon: Transformations in Matter and Energy ([Carbon TIME](https://carbontime.create4stem.msu.edu/))* is a science education program that includes publicly available teaching units, assessments, teacher professional development, and teacher networks based in local education agencies. 

Since 2015, 145 teachers and over 25,000 students from across the U.S. have participated in Carbon TIME. Evidence demonstrates that participating students achieve challenging three-dimensional learning goals consistent with [NGSS](https://www.nextgenscience.org/).
