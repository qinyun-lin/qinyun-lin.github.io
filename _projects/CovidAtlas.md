**My role:** Project Co-Founder (2020 - 2022), with [Dr. Marynia Kolak](https://ggis.illinois.edu/directory/profile/mkolak) (PI) and Dr. Xun Li

[The US Covid Atlas](https://uscovidatlas.org/) is a free visualization tool, report builder, & community toolkit that connects COVID case data and community indicators across the United States from the beginning of the Pandemic.

The Atlas helps you access county-level data on COVID and the social determinants of health, use spatial analysis, and share stories to better understand the spread in communities and to bolster planning efforts.

In the latest push, we are humanizing the data with oral histories from across the country. You are more than welcome to submit your story [here](https://stories.uscovidatlas.org/)!
