**My role:** Researcher and statistician at Gothenburg University (PI at GU: [Dr. Lauren Lissner](https://www.gu.se/om-universitetet/hitta-person/laurenlissner))

From 2007 to 2016 more than 16,000 participants from 9 European countries participated in the [IDEFICS/I.Family](https://www.ifamilystudy.eu/) study. The aim of the study is to understand how lifestyle changes from childhood to young adulthood affect health and how to prevent certain diseases.
